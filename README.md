# ðŸŒ€ ControlNeXt-SVD-v2

This is our implementation of ControlNeXt based on [Stable Video Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt-1-1). It can be seen as an attempt to replicate the implementation of [AnimateAnyone](https://github.com/HumanAIGC/AnimateAnyone) with a more concise and efficient architecture.

Compared to image generation, video generation poses significantly greater challenges. While direct training of the generation model using our method is feasible, we also employ various engineering strategies to enhance performance. Although they are irrespective of academic algorithms.

# Base Model

For the v2 version, we adopt the below operations to improve the performance:
* We have collected a higher-quality dataset with higher resolution to train our model.
* We have extended the training and inference batch frames to 24.
* We have extended the video height and width to a resolution of 576 Ã— 1024.
* We conduct extensive continual training of SVD on human-related videos to enhance its ability to generate human-related content.
* We adopt fp32.
* We adopt the pose alignment during the inference following the related.

### Reference Image

It is crucial to ensure that the reference image is clear and easily understandable, especially aligning the face of the reference with the pose.

### Continuously Finetune

To significantly enhance performance on a specific pose sequence, you can continuously fine-tune the model for just a few hundred steps. 

We will release the related fine-tuning code later.

### Pose Generation

We adopt [DWPose](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DWPose) for the pose generation, and follow the related work ([1](https://humanaigc.github.io/animate-anyone/), [2](https://tencent.github.io/MimicMotion/)) to align the pose.

# Limitations

## IP Consistency

We did not prioritize maintaining IP consistency during the development of the generation model and now rely on a helper model for face enhancement. 

However, additional training can be implemented to ensure IP consistency moving forward.

This also leaves a possible direction for futher improvement.

## Base model

The base model plays a crucial role in generating human features, particularly hands and faces. We encourage collaboration to improve the base model for enhanced human-related video generation.
